            The style and musicality of rock music was heavily influenced 
            by blues traditions and rhythm and blues (also known as R&B) from the early 20th century. 
            It was born out of the natural evolution of many musical styles from the 1930s and 1940s, 
            including swing, gospel, country, and folk

          <p>Rock and roll (often written as rock & roll, rock 'n' roll, or rock 'n roll) 
            is a genre of popular music that originated and evolved in the 
            United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s from musical 
            styles such as gospel, jump blues, jazz, boogie woogie, rhythm and blues,
            and country music. While elements of what was to become rock and roll can be 
            heard in blues records from the 1920s and in country records of the 1930s, 
            the genre did not acquire its name until 1954.</p>

          <p>
            Gothic rock (alternately called goth-rock or goth) 
            is a style of rock music that emerged from post-punk 
            in the United Kingdom in the late 1970s. 
            The first post-punk bands which shifted towards dark music 
            with gothic overtones include Siouxsie and the Banshees, 
            Joy Division, Bauhaus, and the Cure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The genre itself was defined as a separate movement from post-punk. 
            Gothic rock stood out due to its more dark sound, with minor or bass 
            chords, reverbs, dark arrangements or dramatic and melancholic melodies, 
            having inspirations in gothic literature allied with themes such as sadness, 
            existentialism, nihilism, dark romanticism, tragedy, melancholy and morbidity. 
            These themes are often approached in a poetic way. The sensibilities of the 
            genre led the lyrics to represent the evil of the century and the romantic 
            idealization of death and the supernatural imagination.

            Heavy metal, genre of rock music that includes a group of related styles that 
            are intense, virtuosic, and powerful. Driven by the aggressive sounds of the 
            distorted electric guitar, heavy metal is arguably the most commercially 
            successful genre of rock music.
          </p>
          <p>
            Although the origin of the term heavy metal is widely attributed to novelist 
            William Burroughs, its use actually dates well back into the 19th century, 
            when it referred to cannon or to power more generally. It also has been used 
            to classify certain elements or compounds, as in the phrase heavy metal 
            poisoning. Heavy metal appeared in the lyrics of Steppenwolf’s 
            “Born to be Wild” (1968), and by the early 1970s rock critics were using 
            it to refer to a specific style of music.

          <p>
            Grunge (sometimes referred to as the Seattle sound) is an alternative rock 
            genre and subculture that emerged during the mid-1980s in the American Pacific 
            Northwest state of Washington, particularly in Seattle and nearby towns. 
            The style became known as a hybrid of punk and metal.[6] The early grunge 
            movement revolved around Seattle's independent record label Sub Pop and 
            the region's underground music scene. 
          </p>
          <p>
            The owners of Sub Pop marketed the 
            style shrewdly and the media was encouraged to describe it as "grunge". 
            By the early 1990s, its popularity had spread, with grunge bands appearing in 
            California, then emerging in other parts of the United States and in Australia, 
            building strong followings and signing major record deals.

          <p>
            Indie rock is a genre of rock music that originated in the United States and 
            United Kingdom in the 1970s. Originally used to describe independent record 
            labels, the term became associated with the music they produced and was 
            initially used interchangeably with alternative rock or "guitar pop rock". 
            In the 1980s, the use of the term "indie" (or "indie pop") started to shift 
            from its reference to recording companies to describe the style of music 
            produced on punk and post-punk labels. 
          </p>
          <p>
            During the 1990s, grunge and punk 
            revival bands in the US and Britpop bands in the UK broke into the mainstream, 
            and the term "alternative" lost its original counter-cultural meaning. 
            The term "indie rock" became associated with the bands and genres that remained 
            dicated to their independent status. By the end of the 1990s, indie rock 
            developed several subgenres and related styles, including lo-fi, noise pop, 
            emo, slowcore, post-rock, and math rock. In the 2000s, changes in the music 
            industry and a growing importance of the Internet enabled 
            a new wave of indie rock bands to achieve mainstream success, 
            leading to questions about its meaningfulness as a term.
